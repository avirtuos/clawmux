I just tried using clawdmux on a new task and when the Intake Agent completed, this the last text that appeared at the bottom of the "Agent Activity" tab. there are two issues with this. Firstly, it is showing me the raw JSON output of the Input Agent (see where is starts with {"action": ). That msg should have been processed by clawdmux as the "end" of the Intake Agent and then displayed as markdown. The second issue illustrated here is the very last line of the output, we are truncating it with a "...". We should be showing the entire message there. Can you present me a plan that explains why this is happening and also how we can correct these behaviors to match my expectations.

The task file is clear, complete, and well-specified. I have reviewed all relevant context including the task file (`tasks/3.1.md`), the system design document (`docs/design.md`), and the requirements document (`docs/requirements.md`). The task is unambiguous and contains all necessary information for downstream agents to proceed.

{"action":"complete","summary":"Reviewed Task 3.1 (Next.js project scaffolding) — the task has a clear description covering Next.js 14+/App Router/TypeScript/Tailwind/shadcn/ui initialization, all required dependencies listed with version constraints, all config files enumerated, all .env.example keys specified, the root layout and shadcn/ui component list defined, a build/dev verification requirement, and six explicit acceptance test names; the design.md provides full project structure and architectural context needed by downstream agents.

Lastly, the code diff tab is always empty. I suspect we shouldn't be using opencode's diff API for the code diff tab.

pending approval for next agent, should say "pending approval for XXXXX agent"



Still some cases where Agent Activity is being hidden off screen at the bottom even when prompt window is not present. I'm not sure if this is a buffering issues (e.g. text
not actually written to the activity window or what) but I see cases when I am asked to approve a move to the next agent and as soon as I do i see some more text from
the previous agent. This actually happened where the agent prompted for permission but that activity was hidden off screen which made it look like the agent was stuck.
Can we look at why some text is still offscreen at the bottom? Also, can we change tool prompt approval to be a "popup" in the Agent Activity tab just to help mitigate 
that particular issue. We still need to find real root cause of the hidden text.



I also see some ignored messages in the logs that look like they contain useful agent activity. Why were they ignored and can/should we be displaying this in the Agent Activity tab?

We had several strange issues occur:

1. It looked like multiple agents were writing to the agent activity tab at the same time as different parts of the screen were being updated at the same time,
with some parts of the scroll back history being overwritten.
2. I saw these errors: "Agent output could not be parsed; advancing" multiple times in the Agent Activity tab
3. The Team Status and work load said the task had been assigned to Human for review but I still saw activity actively being written in the agent activity tab.

---

Can we make sure the current status of the team is always in the bottom right? If the task is completed then show that (Completed - No Active Agent) or (Open - No Active Agent).

----

We need to fix some of the formatting in the Agent Activity tab

Agent Activity scrolling still seems to allow 5 or 6 lines to be off screen at the bottom even when the prompt box is hidden. 
This is most obvious when an agent finishes working and the activity tab is cut off mid-sentence. Then when you advance it to the next
agent, you see text scroll up that is clearly from the previous agent.
